# Curate an EDC Pouch: Technical Overview and Rationale

## Motivation

The project addresses the practical problem of carrying a set of essential tools in a way that minimizes friction in daily tasks. The author observed a disorganized collection of tools and pouches, which led to inefficiency and inconvenience. The solution is to curate a single, compact, and modular pouch that can be carried in multiple types of bags and serve as a base kit for various scenarios.

## Problem Statement

Everyday Carry (EDC) kits often suffer from being either too bulky or insufficiently thought out in terms of utility. The challenge is to balance size, weight, and functionality while ensuring the kit can adapt to different contexts. Additionally, the kit should be justified by actual use cases rather than aspirational needs.

## Project Construction

The project is documented primarily through Markdown files and images. The core documentation (`index.md`) outlines the guiding principles, supply audit, and justification for each item included in the pouch. Visual assets provide context and support for the choices made.

### Guiding Principles

- Tools must reduce friction in everyday life.
- The pouch must be small enough to fit inside all bags used regularly.
- The toolset should be modular to allow expansion or adaptation.

### Supply Audit

The supply list is grounded in available resources rather than new acquisitions. It includes:

1. A nylon pouch (repurposed from a trauma kit)
2. Swiss Army knife (with multiple blades and tools)
3. 4-inch crescent wrench
4. Clorox wipes
5. Cash
6. Notepad
7. Pen
8. Cell phone charging block
9. USB-C cable
10. First aid kit
11. Opinel No. 7 carbon knife
12. Latex gloves

Each item is justified based on its utility and portability. For example, the pouch size is validated by its fit in a sling bag and haversack, and the Swiss Army knife is favored for its versatility.

## Implementation Details

The project does not involve software development or runtime components. Instead, it is a curated documentation effort that combines rationale, lists, and photographic evidence. The `index.md` file is structured with metadata for title, date, author, tags, and categories, suggesting integration with a static site generator or documentation platform.

Images in the `images/` directory complement the text by showing the pouch and its contents, which aids in visual verification and future reference.

## Practical Considerations

- The pouch is designed to be a base kit, allowing for modular additions depending on specific needs.
- Weight and space are critical constraints, influencing the choice of items.
- The documentation serves as a living document to be updated based on real-world testing and evolving requirements.

## Summary

This project exemplifies a methodical approach to organizing an EDC pouch by focusing on practical utility, modularity, and portability. It leverages simple documentation and visual aids to create a reference that can be revisited and refined over time. The absence of software components underscores its role as a personal project centered on physical organization rather than code.
