# Curate an EDC Pouch: A Technical Reference

## Motivation

The project addresses a common organizational problem: the random accumulation of tools and supplies scattered across different bags and locations. The objective is to consolidate these items into a single, portable pouch that can be carried consistently. This approach reduces friction in daily tasks by ensuring essential tools are always accessible.

## Problem Statement

Without a dedicated kit, tools are often misplaced or forgotten, leading to inefficiency and inconvenience. A well-curated EDC pouch mitigates this by providing a reliable, repeatable solution for carrying necessary items.

## Project Overview

The repository documents the selection, justification, and organization of items within an EDC pouch. It is not a software project but rather a knowledge base and audit of physical supplies.

## Implementation Details

### Supply List

The pouch includes:

1. A nylon pouch previously used for trauma supplies
2. Swiss Army Knife (Tinker model) with multiple blades and a can opener
3. 4-inch crescent wrench
4. Clorox wipes
5. Cash
6. Notepad
7. Pen
8. Cell phone charging block
9. USB-C cable
10. Basic first aid kit
11. Opinel No. 7 Carbon Knife
12. Latex gloves

### Justification

- **Pouch**: Selected for size and portability; fits in multiple bags.
- **Swiss Army Knife**: Multi-tool reduces need for multiple separate tools.
- **Modularity**: The kit is designed to serve as a base for other specialized kits.

### Design Principles

- Minimize friction in daily tasks by having tools readily available.
- Keep the pouch small enough to fit in all bags.
- Maintain modularity to allow expansion or adaptation.

### Practical Considerations

Weight and space constraints are balanced against utility. The pouch avoids overloading by focusing on tools that address the most common needs.

## Usage Notes

The pouch contents are subject to ongoing evaluation. Real-world use will inform additions or removals to optimize effectiveness.

## Conclusion

This project is a practical exercise in physical organization and preparedness. It documents the rationale behind item selection and pouch configuration, serving as a reference for future modifications or similar projects.
