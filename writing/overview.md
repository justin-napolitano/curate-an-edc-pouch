I've always been fascinated by the concept of Everyday Carry (EDC). It's about having the right tools on hand for daily challenges. This led me to create a GitHub repository called [curate-an-edc-pouch](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/curate-an-edc-pouch). It's an ongoing project dedicated to assembling a compact, modular EDC pouch that suits a variety of needs.

## Why EDC?

Everyday carry doesn’t just mean carrying random tools. It’s about being prepared for the unexpected. I wanted to build a kit that’s not only functional but also versatile enough to fit in different bags without taking up too much space.

My aim is to create a well-organized toolkit that addresses common daily issues. Think of it as having a mini Swiss Army knife in your bag, but more tailored to everyday situations. This isn’t just a kit for the outdoors; it's designed for urban environments too.

## Key Design Decisions

I approached this project with a couple of core design principles:

- **Compactness:** Every item needs to justify its place. A cluttered pouch isn’t helpful.
- **Modularity:** I wanted a setup that allows swapping items in and out. Life changes, and so do our needs.
- **Documentation:** I felt that meticulous documentation was crucial. This way, I can track what works and what doesn’t.

These principles drive the curation process and make it easier for others to customize their own EDC experience.

## The Tech Stack

While this might seem like a simple project, the way it’s documented plays a significant role:

- **Markdown:** This is my go-to for documentation. It’s clean and easy to read.
- **Images:** Visuals are essential. They not only show what’s included but also how everything fits together.

The repository structure is pretty straightforward:

```
curate-an-edc-pouch/
├── images/            # Contains images of the EDC pouch and its contents
└── index.md           # Main file detailing the project rationale and supply list
```

The `index.md` file dives into the rationale for each item, ensuring every piece has a reason for existing. Meanwhile, the `images/` folder adds a visual reference to help viewers understand the setup better.

## Getting Started

I throw this repository together mainly as documentation and visual aids, so there are no complex setups involved. If you want to check it out, just clone the repo like so:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/curate-an-edc-pouch.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd curate-an-edc-pouch

# Open index.md with a Markdown viewer or editor
```

You can browse through the organized structure and easily find all the details about what I’ve put together.

## Future Work and Roadmap

This project is a living document, and there’s always room for improvement. Here’s what’s on my radar:

- **Expand the Supply List:** I want to include more items based on real-world testing and user input. What works for me might not work for everyone.
- **Modular Customization:** Building a system that allows users to easily customize their pouches for different scenarios would be fantastic.
- **Digital Integration:** I’m considering a digital checklist or an app to help track pouch contents, especially if it can incorporate some sort of notifications or reminders.
- **Material Exploration:** Lightweight or alternative materials could enhance the pouch's durability and usability without sacrificing weight.
- **Ongoing Documentation:** As I use the pouch in various settings, I’ll keep documenting lessons learned. It’s about evolving the pouch with every experience.

## Wrap Up

Overall, I hope this project stands out as a practical reference for anyone interested in optimizing their daily carry. An EDC pouch isn’t just a collection of items; it’s a carefully curated toolkit that can make life just a bit more manageable.

If you’re keen on updates or want to discuss ideas, I’m active on social media. You can find me on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X, sharing insights and engaging with the community around EDC concepts and beyond.

So, check out the repo, explore the possibilities, and let’s optimize our everyday carry together!
